# Assignment Overview

Read this lab assignment in its entirety before beginning your lab. You may want to [open it in a new tab](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-08/lab-b/){:target="_blank"}.

## Problem Domain

[Pat's Salmon Cookies](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-06/lab/){:target="_blank"} problem domain can be found here!

## Instructions

Continue working on the functionality of your `sales.html` page if you do not have it working 100% yet, including the row of totals across the bottom.

Pat has provided you 7 additional images that they would like to see on the home page of the site. These images are located in your daily class GitHub repo: `class-08/lab-b/assets/`.

Your public-facing **index.html** page should include the following:

  1. locations with addresses,
  1. hours open
  1. contact information
  1. Anything else you feel necessary.
  1. A link to your `sales.html` page
     - Be sure to also include a link to your `index.html` page on your `sales.html` pages as well.

Feel free to make this information up. Get creative, have fun, but remember to be professional.

Run your Lighthouse Accessibilty report. We are looking for a score between 65-80. Analyze the report to see what changes you can make to your site that will improve your score. Add a screenshot of your score to your README.md.

### Stretch Goals

- Add the ability for your users to choose among multiple display or color profiles for the page. Clicking a button should allow them to choose (for instance) whether the text is dark on a light background, or the text is light on a dark background. You can also experiment with changing up the style: make a version of your display that mimics a newspaper, or an Excel spreadsheet, or Roman chiseling in stone. (But make sure the user can choose a more normal style, too!) You can also experiment with using a `select` input to choose the style.

- Make a style guide, using either [Starbucks React Components Pattern Library](https://www.starbucks.com/developer/pattern-library/guidelines/) or [Starbucks - High level Guide](https://creative.starbucks.com/) as a model.

- Make two additional pages:
  - Mock up an order form that would be public facing (**store.html**) so that visitors to the website can order salmon cookies and swag. That form would need to receive all of the things you'd expect on an order form: name, address, payment info, products to order, quantities, special instructions, and so on.
  - A second 'private' page (**order-processing.html**) that shows a list of pending orders and the individual order details. The business owner can then process the orders by clicking a button next to the order that then moves that list item to a 'Filled Orders' list at the bottom of the page.
