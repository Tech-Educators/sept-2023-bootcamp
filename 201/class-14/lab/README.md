# Lab: Data Storage, Retrieval, and Charting

Read the document in its entirety before beginning your lab.

## Problem Domain

The design team has decided to extract the chart from the voting page and move it to a separate results page on the website. We will need to create a new page for the chart, link to it, and then have that page generate the chart, using the voting data from the main page.

At any time, a user should be able to revisit the chart page and see the last set of voting results.

## Instructions


1. The `index.html` is where the users will be voting on the items.
1. The `chart.html` page will display the voting results using Chart.js.

### Tips

Here are some things to think about as you go plan out the lab for today:

- You'll need to use local storage to share data between the two HTML pages.
- If in a pair, you and your partner should plan out how you want to collaboratively attack the problem with regards to pair programming. It's up to you how the details are managed, but make sure each partner makes contributions in both CSS and JS files.
- Make small changes, and test them as you go.

### In a nutshell

- Give the app some style.
- Deploy the app.
