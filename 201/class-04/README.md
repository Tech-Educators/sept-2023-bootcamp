# JS Functions, Pair Programming, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Overview

In this class we will be learning about one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript: functions! We will also discuss and demonstrate pair programming, and CSS positioning.

## Class Outline

- Code review of previous day's lab assignment
- Code Demo
  - Functions
  - CSS positioning
- Lab preview and prep

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- The use and purpose of functions with JavaScript.
- The role of both a driver and a navigator in a pair programming session.
- The importance of positioning within CSS.

#### Execute

- Demonstrate understanding of how functions work in JavaScript, as well as the component pieces including declarations, calls, parameters, arguments, and returns.
- Successfully pair program with a fellow student and manage the collaborative and version control aspects of working with Git (from the command line) and GitHub (in the browser).
- Demonstrate understanding of CSS layout principles including block, inline, normal, relative, absolute, float, and fixed positioning.

## Notes

1. What is a function?

1. A function definition may also be referred to as a function `__________` or a function `___________`.

1. Function `__________` is used to execute the code within the function.

1. What are some popular values for the position property?

### PAIR PROGRAMMING

Here's the basics of what you need to know about _pair programming_. This is a methodology for work in software development that is increasingly more popular and widespread (not only in development work, but also in interview processes), and we place a high value on training our students to pair program effectively. There's more details in the lab assignment.

- In pair programming there are two developers working on a single body of code on a single computer.
- One member of the pair is the Driver, and this person will be the one doing all of the actual typing work on the laptop. The Driver will be working on the Navigator's code by way of forking and cloning the Navigator's repository.
- The other member of the pair is the Navigator, and this person will work with only their voice and their thoughts.
- The Navigator does not touch the keyboard, nor does the Navigator work on their laptop "on the side". The Navigator is fully engaged with the work that the pair is doing, typically using a piece of scratch paper to sketch diagrams, take notes, or list ideas. At most the Navigator uses their laptop to perhaps keep a copy of this assignment document open or to look up something needed to write the code, such as a reference page like MDN.
- Under no circumstances does the Navigator work on any code on their laptop: for the pair programming process to be effective, both parties must be fully engaged on the code they're working on together.
- The lab time should be divided into two sections of approximately two hours each. At the halfway mark, you should swap roles and work on the other person's code. Remember to watch the clock and determine the best point to swap roles.
- In the case of an odd number of students, one group will have three members and they should rotate through three roles: Driver, Navigator, Observer. Each student should take on each role one time. They will need to be even more mindful about watching the clock to ensure that equal time is devoted to all three roles.
