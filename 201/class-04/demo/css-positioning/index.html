    <h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
    <p>
      We can move elements by declaring their top, right, bottom or left
      position. But CSS positioning properties such as static, relative,
      absolute and fixed, will determine how those rules are interpreted.

    <section>
      <p>
        This Section tag with a red border uses the default value "position:
        static." See what happens to the "absolute" elements if you change this
        Section tag to "position: relative."
      </p>

      <article id="one">
        <h2>Position: relative</h2>
        <p>
          It will display exactly the same as before until you also assign its
          postion using: left, right, top or bottom. This will position it that
          distance relative to its original position.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article id="two">
        <h2>Position: absolute</h2>
        <p>
          This element displays relative to its most recent parent element with
          positioning set. If it has no positioned parent, it will display
          relative to the page window.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article id="four">
        <h2>Help!</h2>
        <p>I am also positioned: absolute. The fixed element is blocking me.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="three">
        <h2>Position: fixed</h2>
        <p>
          This will position the element relative to the viewport. It will stay
          in the same place even if the page scrolls, be careful! It can block
          content on your page unless you account for it by adding padding or
          margin to other elements. See the div asking for help? Adjust the size
          of the browser and you will see some cases where that div is
          completely hidden by this fixed element.
