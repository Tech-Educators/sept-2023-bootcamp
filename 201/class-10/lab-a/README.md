## Problem Domain

Your boss comes up to you just before lunch: "OK, we just picked up this job, but I need it on my desk (well, in my inbox) in four hours. It doesn't need to be perfect... it needs to be as close to perfect as you can get it in that time."

In lab today you will be building a single webpage based off of the provided design comp assets. This assignment is a lot of HTML and CSS, and not as much JS as we've been doing this week. In fact, you may choose to do this project with no JS at all, or just add some as a finishing touch.

When available, your instructor will pair you with a partner for this lab. You are free to set up whatever workflow you choose with your partner.

You only have 4 hours to complete this assignment.

## Instructions

It is your job to create a page that looks ***exactly*** like the preview below. Within your GitHub class repo, under today's directory, you will find all of the assets required to accomplish this task in addition to a larger version of this preview image.

Use your notes from class, your readings, classmates, and the internet to assist with the completion of the lab. Research what you need and don't be afraid to try different techniques.

Create a new repository for today called **chocolate-pizza**. If partnered for this lab, follow the pair programming work flow by having one user fork the other so that you can get some practice in your Git processes. Be sure to do frequent commits, and always do your work on branches. Before starting coding, think about a strategy for approaching this project. Before writing code, think about a practical order in which to do the work:

- When should you focus on styling?
- When should you make a decision about a layout scheme?
- When should you just build out the structure of the HTML?
- When you should you add JS? Do you even add JS?

***If partnered, make sure to "swap" driver and navigator 2 hours into the challenge***.

Suggestion: Set up your work directory like this:

- index.html
- style.css
- app.js *(if you choose to use JS)*
- img/   *(a directory that contains all of your image assets)*

If you want to rename any of the image files, feel free to do so. The same goes for pretty much anything else you come up with as a way to do the work.

### Stretch Goals

After completing all of the requirements listed above, you may optionally challenge yourself further by implementing some or all of the following into your application:

1. Add some JavaScript to your page.
   - Make the checkboxes actually check using JavaScript!
1. Refactor your code and optimize it further.

## Resources

Refer to the daily class repo for your assets required for this lab as well as a larger version of the preview image located above.
