# Project Week: Milestone 4

## Presentation Prep

1. Plan your presentation... have a script:

- Introduction - What is the problem? What is your solution?
- Functionality walk through
- Any technical issues you overcame?

2. Rehearse your presentation:

- Pretend you are presenting it to the class, maybe grab a classmate and present to them
- Set a timer. Know how much time each segment will take.

3. Overall presentation script (a suggestion, not required):

- 1 minute - Intro/demo
- 1-2 minutes - Technical challenge in the code
- Q&A
