# Project Week: Milestone 1

## Planning phase

Welcome to project week! This first day is all about scoping your project and getting it planned out. You have a lot to do today...let's get started.

### User stories

Write user stories for each possible role. User stories follow the format of: `As a ____, I want ____ so that ____`. Remember, user stories tell...

- Who needs a feature (and a brief descriptor of their role/relationship to the app)
- What they want that feature to do
- Why they want it

If you want a feature in the app, you MUST have at least one user story (preferably more, if multiple users want it) that requires it. No exceptions.

Write your user stories in a `user-stories.md` file in your repo.

### Establish MVP

Now for the hard part. Take your user stories and prioritize.

What absolutely has to be part of your app for it to ship? (Another way to think of this is: if the app is missing a certain feature, can you still use it?) This is your MVP. In your `user-stories.md` file, move these user stories into an MVP section.

The remaining user stories are your stretch goals. In the `user-stories.md` file, move them into a "Stretch Goals" section. Then, list them in order from easiest to implement (at the top) to hardest to implement (at the bottom). If you get your MVP done and still have time, you'll tackle the stretch goals.

### Project Domain/Data models

Now, take the MVP and grab a whiteboard. Create some drawings that show how you will model your real-world problem in code. What objects and methods do you need? How do they relate to and interact with each other? How will you store your data? Take a picture of your model(s) and add them to your repo, in a folder called `domain-models`.

### Wireframes

Create wireframes for each of your pages. Start with pencil-and-paper. After that, save them to your repo in a folder called `wireframes`. You can either take pictures of your pencil-and-paper wireframes, or use a wireframe creation tool (there are many online).

### Project proposals

Finally, find your instructor and present your proposal. (First come, first served.) You must have your:

- Project pitch
- Group agreement
- User stories
- Domain/data models
- Wireframes

### Technical requirements

Once you have instructor approval, break your MVP user stories down into technical requirements. Save these in a `technical-requirements.md` file in your repo.

### Tasks and your GitHub project

Almost there! Now that you have your technical requirements done, it's time to set up your project in GitHub and create tasks.

In your repo, create a project. Give it three columns: `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`.

Now, look at your technical requirements. For each one, determine what, exactly, needs to be done in code. Then, break this work down into 30 minute to 2-hour chunks. Each one of these "chunks" will be a task - a.k.a. an "issue" on GitHub.

For each task, create a card in the GitHub project. Turn each one into a GitHub issue. In the issue, give a brief explanation of what needs to be done; reference wireframes/data models/etc. if need be. Assign the issue to each person who works on the issue.

Finally, arrange the To Dos in order of what needs to be completed first. As you arrange, give some thought as to what issues "block" other ones. Strive to get your HTML and JS to MVP first. This means you probably won't be writing much CSS until then. Get the functionality done first, before you get too deep into CSS.

### Review

At this point, go take a 15-minute break. (Really. We mean it. You need your brain to take a break before your final review of your tasks.) Finally, as a group, review your user stories and tasks one more time to see if there are any needed changes.

### Start coding

Now you can start writing some code! Pick up tasks in the order that they need to be completed. You can pair-program or not, based on what you think will be more efficient for your team.

Good luck, and may the code be with you.
