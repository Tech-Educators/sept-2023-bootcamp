## Notes

### Unix & Git

Introduction to core the concepts of file management from the command line and the fundamentals of Git and GitHub.

- `pwd` = print working directory
- `tree` = shows the file tree of your directory
- `ls` = list all the files and folders located in your current directory
- `ls -a` = list all the files and folders located in your current directory including hidden files in short form
- `ls -la` = list all the files and folders located in your current directory including hidden files in a more detailed form
- `cd` = change directory
- `mkdir` = make directory
- `touch` = create a new file
- `code <filename>` = open up this file in VSCode
- `code .` = open the current directory in VSCode
- `mv` = move a file
- `rm <filename>` = remove a file permanently. Warning: there is no recovery!
- `cp <source> <destination>` = copy a file

### Additional VSCode Settings

In the lower left-hand corner of VSCode, click on the gear icon and select "Settings". Use the search functionality to set the following values:

- "editor.tabSize" should be set to 2
- "editor.detectIndentation" should be set to true
- "editor.wordWrap" should be set to "on"
