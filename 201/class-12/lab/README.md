## Instructions

Below are your lab requirements in a user story format. Try and think up what the feature tasks would be for each story, once you are done, or you get stuck, review the provided feature tasks to see what the actual tasks are for each story.

1. As a marketeer, I want to prevent users from seeing the same image in two subsequent iterations, so that they are not biased.

   - Update your algorithm to randomly generate three unique product images from the images directory.
   - Update your algorithm so that new products are generated, confirm that these products are not duplicates from the immediate previous set.

1. As a marketing manager, I would like a visual representation of how many times a product was clicked so that I can visually analyze the results.

   - Using ChartJS (imported from CDN), display the vote totals and the number of times a product was viewed in a bar chart format. (hint: don't forget about the `<canvas>` tags)
   - Place the bar chart in the section located beneath your three product images
   - The bar charts should only appear _after_ all voting data has been collected.

1. Run a Lighthouse Accessbility report. Make necessary updates to your application based on the report to get your score above 80.

   - Add a screenshot of your score to your README.md file.

### Stretch Goals

Try some additional charting types based off of some of the other data you collected and display them in addition to the required bar chart

## Developer Style Guide

- Do today's work on a branch called `dataviz`.

This is an individual assignment today, but you are free to collaborate with classmates if you want. Just be sure that if you do, be sure to make note of that collaboration in your README file.
