# Refactoring with JS Functions

## Setup and Documentation

Start with your existing code. Ensure it's all working as expected.

## Requirements

Use functions to improve the clarity and readability of your code.

Wrap related steps into a single function. Be sure you are properly defining the function, calling it, and getting the return value you expect.

Can you see how you might use just a single `<script>` tag with a `src` attribute to access your JS, and then specific function calls throughout the rest of your page?

Add a check to the user input you are getting, to see if the initial user input is an acceptable value. If not, present the user with an error message and a second chance to enter a proper value.

### Stretch Goal

Using only conditionals and functions, modify your input validation code to continue checking the user input until the value entered is acceptable.

### Submission Instructions

Share in the discussion a part of the code you are most proud of. Explain here how it came to be, and why you like it. Check out what your classmates did!
