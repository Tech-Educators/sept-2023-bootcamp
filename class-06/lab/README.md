# Dynamic Pages with JavaScript

## Setup and Documentation

Review your page's wireframe. Look at the content, and select a few places where you could add in something dynamic.

## Requirements

Add at least 3 dynamic components to your web page. These can be based on user input, or other dynamic input data.

At least one dynamic component should be based on user input.

At least one dynamic component should use a conditional statement to determine the output.

### Stretch Goals

Try out the `confirm()` function, in addition to `prompt()`. When's the right time to use this?

If the user gives you a color, can you set a part of your page to be that color?

### Submission Instructions

Deploy your dynamic web page, and share the public URL on Canvas. Check out what your classmates made as well!
