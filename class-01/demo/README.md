# Lab 01 - Create a GitHub Pages Site

Here are the steps we used to create a GitHub Pages site:

- Log in to GitHub
- Click the "New" button on the left of the page
- In the name of the repository, write "reading-notes"
- IMPORTANT check the "Add a README.md" box
- Click "Create Repository"

Now you have the repo, you can add publish it with GitHub Pages:

- Go to Settings (it's on the ribbon at the top of the page)
- Click "Pages" on the left hand side
- Click the "None" button and select "main"
- Click "Save"

Wait a minute or two and go to https://USERNAME.github.io/reading-notes/ replcaing USERNAME with your own username and it should show you what you've written in your README.md!!
