# Create a Portfolio

This is a wide open task, make of it what you will.

The only requirements are:

- Make a React app
- Give it multiple pages
- Write about you throughout the website

After you've done that:

- Use state
- Use props
- Accept user input (onClick, onChange, onSubmit etc) in at least 2 different ways
