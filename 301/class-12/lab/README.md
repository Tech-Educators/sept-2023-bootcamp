# Resource Create and Delete

## Overview

In this class you will add the functionality for the user to create a book resource in the database or delete one. A book will be created from a form in React, and sent to the server where it will be saved into the database, and then returned to the front end to be displayed in the list of favorite books. You will then be able to delete that book with a click of a button, to have it instantly removed from the front end, with a request sent to back end for removal.

## Feature Tasks - CREATE and DELETE of CRUD

## Overview

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations

<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
```

## Time Estimates

For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

```markdown
Name of feature: **************\_\_\_\_**************

Estimate of time needed to complete: **\_**

Start time: **\_**

Finish time: **\_**

Actual time needed to complete: **\_**
```

Add this information to your README.
