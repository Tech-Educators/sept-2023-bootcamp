# Update a Resource

## Overview

In this class you will complete your full stack CRUD application by adding an UPDATE route. You will add a button to each book that, when clicked, will display a form where the user can change information about that book. That information will be sent to the server where it will replace what's already in the database for that record.

## Feature Tasks â€” UPDATE of CRUD

See your team's Trello board for this lab's feature tasks.

## Documentation

You must have a complete `README.md` for your repository.

_Your `README.md` must include:_

```md
# Project Name

**Author**: Team Member Names Goes Here
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations

<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
```

## Time Estimates

For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

```markdown
Name of feature: **************\_\_\_\_**************

Estimate of time needed to complete: **\_**

Start time: **\_**

Finish time: **\_**

Actual time needed to complete: **\_**
```

Add this information to your README.
