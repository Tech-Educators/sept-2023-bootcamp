lets learn some html

## HTML-Only Web Site from Scratch

We now know that Markdown + GitHub Pages is powerful for creating quick sites! To embrace the next level of challenge, it's time we go back to crafting our web pages from scratch, by hand, line by line.

## Setup and Documentation
Review the web site creation process from your reading assignment.

## Requirements
Partner up. Decide on a topic for the web site you want to build. Each person will be responsible for 1 page of the site.

Together, draw a single wireframe on a whiteboard, that can be used for all the pages of your site.

Keep it at low-fidelity.

Identify the general content areas.

Think carefully! This is what you are going to code up in markup.

Apply html to the structure

Discuss with your partner what html tags should be used for each part of your wireframe.

Think carefully about how the html elements will be nested.

Choose your verbiage

Write out the key content to fill in each page's content areas of the wireframe.

You don't need full sentences, but at least a plan for each area of each page.

Have your instructor review your wireframe and html plan.

Write the code!

Each partner creates their own repository to work from. How do we get a new repository on our local computer?
Each partner codes their own index.html file, matching the wireframe.
From this point forward, all your work should be done locally, in VS Code. New files and changes will reflect in GitHub using your new Git-flow skills! (Remember... A-C-P)
Each partner should end up with their own index.html file containing basically the same html tags, in the same order, but with different content within the tags.
Link up the pages so a user can navigate to both pages.

## Stretch Goals
Utilize some html tags you've never used before.

Submission Instructions
Submit your live url after deploying your site with GitHub pages. Check out what other people built, as well.
